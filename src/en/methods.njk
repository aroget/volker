  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    As part of the seminars I attended and also during my training as a
    non-medical practitioner for psychotherapy, I came into practical contact
    with a few selected psychological counseling tools, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Resource-oriented advice</li>
    <li>Client-centered counseling according to Carl Rogers</li>
    <li>Solution-oriented short-term therapy according to Steve de Shazer</li>
    <li>Systemic issues and perspective</li>
    <li>Definition of goals</li>
    <li>Nonviolent communication according to Rosenberg</li>
    <li>Progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson</li>
    <li>Mindfulness and breathing techniques</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are a variety of approaches to support people psychologically. I do
    not want to give a comprehensive overview at this point. With friendly
    approval I refer you to:

    Of all the existing viewpoints, I prefer mindfulness-based and humanistic
    approaches (client-centered counseling:

    ). They form the core of my consultations.

    I have the attitude that every client already knows the solution to their
    problem within themselves and takes this knowing in the consultation. My
    role is to encourage the emergence of what Rogers calls „actualizing
    tendency“. I do this by carefully reflecting on what you bring to the
    counseling session. The core principles of my work are discretion,
    authenticity, empathy and appreciation, no matter where you stand. An
    encounter at eye level is essential for me - from person to person.
