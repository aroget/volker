  <p>
    I charge 50 € for 60 minutes, 75 € for 90 Minutes or 100 € for 120 Minutes. 
    You get an invoice once the counceling is done.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sessions takes place in public space in Munich or via OnlineCall (I use “Zoom”, and you do not need an account).	
    We can decide together whether we talk outside while walking (walk and talk counceling: https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/walk-and-talk-therapy.html ) or exchange while sitting indoors. 
    Starting point with good weather could be the city park at the „Friedensengel“. I am also open for your proposals, as long as the sourroundings are adequately stable and discreet.

  <p>
    I am subject to the obligation of confidentiality. I must be released from
    this obligation of confidentiality in writing by the client in the event
    that information is provided to third parties, such as cost bearers and even
    also (family) relatives. An exeption from this rule is a therapeutic
    emergency or a hazardous situation.
