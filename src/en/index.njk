        Hello! <br />
        Welcome to my contact page for psychological counseling in Munich. 
        I am offering basic psychological support for people in difficult phases of life, who are looking for an empathetic person for a reflective exchange (also via OnlineCall if requested). 
        Whether interpersonal conflicts,
        personal life questions, fears, bridging the waiting time for a
        psychotherapy place with health insurance - in me you will find a
        listener and a committed, young, patient aspiring therapist. I am
        trained as a “Heilpraktiker für Psychotherapie” (>more in the “About me”
        tab).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am happy if you want to open up to some level and confide in me. I am
        specifically welcoming non-german speakers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Disclaimer: <br />
        The counceling I offer is no psychotherapy according to the “Psychotherapeutengesetz”.
        My work does not replace a doctor or a psychiatrist. 
        In the event of serious crises or acute suicidality and in emergencies, please call the “Oberbayern Psychiatry Crisis Service” 
        around the clock on 0800 655 3000 or the emergency services (No. 112).
