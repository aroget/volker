        Hello! <br />
        welcome to my contact page for psychological counseling in munich. I am
        offering basic psychological support for people who feel the need for
        help. Whether interpersonal conflicts, personal life issues,
        fears&anxietes, bridging the waiting time for a psychotherapy place - in
        me you will find a listener and a committed, young, patient prospective
        therapist. Currently I am in training to become a " Heilpraktiker für
        Psychotherapie " (>more in the "About me" tab).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am happy if you want to open up to some level and confide in me. I am
        specifically welcoming non-german speakers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Disclaimer: <br />
        My offer is no psychotherapy according to the „Psychotherapeutengesetz“.
        I am no medical doctor or „Heilpraktiker“. I am not making diagnosis and
        my work does not replace a medical doctor or „Heilpraktiker“.
        Especially, if you are in a severe psychological crysis or suicidal:
        please contact a psychiatrist or a „psychologischer Psychotherapeut“. In
        case of an psychological emergency, call the free of charge number
        116117.
