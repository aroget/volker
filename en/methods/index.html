  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    As part of the seminars I attended and also during my training as a
    non-medical practitioner for psychotherapy, I came into practical contact
    with a few selected psychological counseling tools, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Resource-oriented advice</li>
    <li>Client-centered counseling according to Carl Rogers</li>
    <li>Solution-oriented short-term therapy according to Steve de Shazer</li>
    <li>Systemic issues and perspective</li>
    <li>Definition of goals</li>
    <li>Nonviolent communication according to Rosenberg</li>
    <li>Progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson</li>
    <li>Mindfulness and breathing techniques</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are a variety of approaches to support people psychologically. I do
    not want to give a comprehensive overview at this point. With friendly
    approval I refer you to:
    <a href="https://www.therapie.de/psyche/info/therapie/einleitung/"

      https://thehumancondition.com/psychotherapy-introduction-benefits/</a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Of all the existing viewpoints, I prefer mindfulness-based and humanistic
    approaches (client-centered counseling:
    <a
      href="https://www.therapie.de/psyche/info/therapie/gespraechspsychotherapie/"
      >https://www.therapie.de/psyche/info/therapie/gespraechspsychotherapie/</a
    >,

      >https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/therapy-types/person-centered-therapy</a
    >
    ). They form the core of my consultations.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have the attitude that every client already knows the solution to their
    problem within themselves and takes this knowing in the consultation. My
    role is to encourage the emergence of what Rogers calls „actualizing
    tendency“. I do this by carefully reflecting on what you bring to the
    counseling session. The core principles of my work are discretion,
    authenticity, empathy and appreciation, no matter where you stand. An
    encounter at eye level is essential for me - from person to person.
  </p>

  <h2>The Body, the Breath and Awareness</h2>
  <p>
    For a couple of years my own breath increasingly draws my attention. There
    is much usefulness in looking more carefully at this phenomenon...
  </p>
  <p>
    The breath has long been seen as a link between the material world, i.e. the
    human body and the mind / psyche. This is reflected in substitute words from
    different languages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Old Indian prana → bodily breath, air | essence of life;</li>
    <li>Chinese Chi → natural air | life energy;</li>
    <li>Greek pneuma → air, breath | spirit, life essence;</li>
    <li>Greek phren → diaphragm | Spirit;</li>
    <li>Hawaiian ha (in aloha) → spirit | wind, air | Breath;</li>
    <li>Jewish ruach → breath | creative spirit;</li>
    <li>Latin spiritus → breath | Spirit</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Likewise in the Slavic languages, spirit and breath have the same linguistic
    roots.
  </p>
  <p>
    The psychotherapist Ernst Andreas Stadter writes: "Is it flat, heavy, light,
    calm, rushed? The breath says a lot, basically everything about my current
    state of mind. That is an ancient wisdom of many peoples and cultures."
  </p>
  <p>
    The psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich ( † 1957) has in this context made an
    interesting observation: he thought he had recognized that psychological
    resistance and defense mechanisms are related to restricted breathing. This
    was confirmed by Stanislav Grof, a Czech psychiatrist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mijares and Bessel van der Kolk also write about this analogously: "By
    observing the rhythm of your breathing, you can see your physical and
    emotional state, and you can change that state by changing your breath...".
  </p>
  <p>
    In our culture, Wilhelm Reich was one of the first to include the body and
    breathing in psychotherapy.
  </p>
  <p>
    His main thesis is that the body accumulates and holds tension in the
    muscles, and occasionally at the same time restricts breathing, to
    unconsciously protect us from unwelcome emotions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reich observed that many people, partly unconsciously, have a very limited
    breathing pattern. A shallow breath, for example, about ten times a minute
    into the upper part of the lungs is widespread.
  </p>
  <p>
    In body psychotherapy a limitation of self-expression is seen as an
    unconscious purpose of such limited breathing. Something must not or should
    not be shown or felt. Full perception and feeling is restricted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is a small bioenergetic exercise (bioenergetic therapy = a form of
    body psychotherapy). Anyone interested is welcome to try it out.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place your hand on your chest and breathe in and out naturally. Notice how
      your chest feels.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove your hand from your chest and place your little finger on your
      belly button while resting the rest of your hand on the abdominal area
      above the belly button below your chest. Breathe in and out, noticing how
      that abdominal area feels under your hand.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place your thumb on your belly button and rest your hand on the abdominal
      area below. Breathe in and breathe out. Feel this area too.
    </li>
    <li>
      Focus your attention on the breath and notice which of the three areas
      described above moves the least during the inhalation. The area of least
      movement indicates an area of "blocked energy." Place your hand on the
      area that is most restricted and increase or deepen your breathing.
    </li>
    <li>
      If this is difficult, it CAN be a sign of chronic tension in this area.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Breathing is a bodily process that can generally take place consciously or
    unconsciously. The conscious modification of the breath is used in many
    spiritual practices, such as the ancient Indian science of breath pranayama,
    Kundalini Yoga, Siddha Yoga, Burmese Buddhist meditation, or Sufi practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been practicing Vipassana Meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka for
    some years. The first step in this form of mindfulness meditation is the
    conscious observation of your own breath (Anapanasati; from the Pali
    anapana=breath in and out and sati=mindfulness, literally "mindfulness of
    breathing"). It is not changed, but left naturally, as it is. If it is fast,
    then it is fast, if it is heavy, then it is heavy...
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, the described body psychotherapies also include the conscious
    observation of the natural breathing process. Compared to the above
    spiritual practices, the modification of the breath at will is NOT part of
    anapanasati.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially two abilities are trained: on the one hand, the "faculty of
    awareness" (latin facultas "ability"). On the other hand, it is to be
    practiced not to react mentally to what is perceived (exercise of equanimity
    = equanimity ≠ indifference).
  </p>
  <p>
    The body position is an upright sitting, as comfortably as possible (e.g. on
    a chair). The back should be straight and the rest of the body relaxed. The
    eyes remain closed. As soon as a distraction occurs in the form of a feeling
    or thought - e.g. after five minutes you realize that you were "somewhere
    else" - you return to the breath.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thoughts are not pursued during practice, they are allowed to come and go,
    arise and die away, without being attached to them. Again: Thoughts are
    allowed to arise and be there, you just shouldn't cling to them, "follow"
    them. From another perspective, it is about intentionally bringing attention
    to the present moment without evaluating what is showing up in the present
    moment. If ratings and judgments occur, it is important to become aware of
    them and not "get caught up" in them, e.g. by mentally "sticking to them"
    (okay, enough metaphors :-).
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus remains on the (natural) breath throughout. The exit of the
    nostrils, for example, can be used as an aid. One can observe the flow of
    air and the sensations there on the inner walls of the nose. "When I breathe
    in, I'm aware that I'm breathing in. When I breathe out, I am aware that I
    am breathing out.” This is a sentence that has often helped me during
    practicing.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a second step of Vipassana, attention is expanded, and the sensations
    throughout the body are systematically focused (body scan). Here, too, it is
    about consciously perceiving without reacting mentally.
  </p>
  <p>
    The systematic practice of mindfulness (methods) is part of many counseling
    and therapeutic approaches (e.g. MBSR or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
    from behavioral therapy). It is an essential part of my work.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is in the nature of things that we have a tendency to seek fulfillment in
    the "outside", in the material world. Buddhism emphasizes that this can only
    be sought (and found?) “inside”. The power of the breath entails
    counteracting this inherent tendency in us. The practice of keeping your
    attention on the natural breath calms the mind. I find two analogies very
    apt here: the mind/mental state as water e.g. a calm forest pond under a
    full moon.
  </p>
  <p>
    When everything is calm, even the rarest animals come out of their hiding
    places to the water. Another metaphor is a cup with dirty water swirling
    around in it. In the course of the meditation, the liquid clears and the
    dirt (= thoughts) settle:
  </p>

  <img src="/assets/images/methods.png" alt="methods analogy" />

  <p>
    After a little practice, the result is most often more serenity, stability
    and clarity. Qualities that strengthen with regular practice and also show
    up outside of formal meditation. Irritability and nervousness and a calm
    state of mind are mutually exclusive. The latter is often the prerequisite
    for any successful psychological intervention/measure.
  </p>

  <p>
    To round off, I want to clarify one more thing: the practice of meditation
    is something I have experience with. It helped me a lot. That is not to say
    that this is the appropriate method of choice for everyone. There is an
    uncalculable number of tools and methods to achieve more clarity and
    minimize mental suffering. It is up to you to decide which approach is the
    right one for you.
