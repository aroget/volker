  <p>
    After a long phase of internal preparation, I would now like to work as a
    psychological consultant. With a successfully completed technical degree
    (Master of Science) and several years of professional experience, I created
    the right container for myself to start this new profession with the
    necessary care, tranquility and leisure. This allows me to take sufficient
    time for each of my clients.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basis of my interest in psychology comes from personally meaningful and
    touching meditation experiences (Vipassana Meditation, as taught by S.N.
    Goenka). A regular meditation practice helps me, in contrast to the
    situation several years ago, to navigate my everyday live (and contact to
    clients) with more ease and awareness.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2020 I started to study psychology (B. Sc.). After few semesters I
    changed to the more practial oriented training called â€žHeilpraktiker fÃ¼r
    Psychotherapieâ€œ (see german
    <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/heilprg/BJNR002510939.html"
      >â€žHeilpraktikergesetzâ€œ </a
    >). Parallel to that in the beginning of 2021 I started visiting several
    further trainings and seminars of different therapy schools. I started to
    benefit from those quickly. Since fall 2022 I am participant of an ongoing
    three year psychotherapeutic training, with a fixed 30-headed group. Therein
    I continue to explore my personal triggers and psychological topics, so that
    I can be less reactive towards the topics my clients bring up. Also it helps
    me not to mix up my own topics with the ones of my clients. The foundational
    principles of my counceling are discretion, authenticity, empathy and
    appreciation, no matter where you stand and are right now. I consider it
    essential to encounter clients on eye level â€“ from human to human.
